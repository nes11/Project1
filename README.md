# RockPaperScissors 

I started with two simple functions written as part of an online training course, and built it up incrementally using Express.js and basic HTML: first as simple function (with hard-coded playerChoice) then with Express.js interpreting query string and finally using HTML buttons.  

Play Rock Paper Scissors against this Express.js server.
